# Contributing
You are here to help on **bitrix24-python3-client**? Awesome, feel welcome and read the following sections to know what and how to work on something. 

It's an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into **bitrix24-python3-client** itself.

## Code of Conduct
All members of our community are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/yarbshk/bitrix24-python3-client/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please make sure you are welcoming and friendly in all of our spaces.

## Issues
Before you submit an issue, please **search the issue tracker**, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we ask you to **provide a minimal reproduction scenario** that include:
- Version of the client used.
- Environment information (3rd-party libraries, technology stack etc.).
- **A use-case that fails!**

If you get stuck at any point you can create a [ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/yarbshk/bitrix24-python3-client/issues).

## Pull requests
**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this free series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

If you would make PR for something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:
1. Create your own fork of the code.
2. **Before start development** be sure you are following:
    - Our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/yarbshk/bitrix24-python3-client/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

    - The code style for the project (please use [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)).
    - Commit message convention (sentence case, present time).
3. Do the changes in your fork.
4. **Write one or more tests** for all features or bug fixes.
5. Provide documentation for all public API methods.
6. Only **if you like the change** and think **the project could use it**:
    - Send a pull request.
    
## Getting started
To **run the project for development** use the following micro guide:
1. Get local copy of the project.
2. Be sure that [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.
3. Create a `.env` file in project root (see `.env-example`).
4. Open root directory of the project in the terminal and run the `docker-compose up` command.

When work has done properly you can start to develop. Good luck!
